                <h2>🐾 Veer</h2>
                <p>Veer was rescued on 21st of may 2023 unexpectedly. We were feeding some of the dogs near our house where a female had given birth to puppies. Veer was one of them but he was the tiniest, weakest of all. We knew something is not good with him as he was 2 months old but looking at him it was difficult to say because he didn’t looked like a 2 months old puppy. We took him home got vet visit and got to know he was underdeveloped that’s the reason he was like the way he was.
                    It was difficult to say if he would survive his head was wobbling, his stomach full of worms , eyes filled with discharge but he not only survived but ruled our hearts. </p>

                <p>Veera was someone's pet dog. She was found in a comatose state on our way to another rescue. Her front leg was all torned. Was critical for 2-3 days. She was soo dehydrated that it was tough for doctor's to say whether she'll survive or not . But our veera didn't give up and stood strong.</p>

                <h2>🐾 Farishta </h2>
                <p>We found him in a very pathetic condition at Vcare pet clinic dehradun. some kind people brought him there he was having fits and was in a comatose state. Later the vets diagnosed him with Malena. He was continuously passing black stools and vomiting black . The vets put him on drips (twice daily) till recovery.We started the necessary treatment but his condition got worse. he was on drips for about 20 days and didnt eat anything. the vets had already given up on him. but miraculously one day after 25 days of not eating anything, he started eating and now gradually he has become the most notorious and the most chatora dog in our family.</p>
